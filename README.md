The Alchemist is the isometric rouge-lite game about alchemistry and dungeons. It was started as a student team project, and now it's my current pet project.
I'm making most of the gameplay mechanics and UI by myself, including the loot system, inventory, and crafting to improve my programming and software architecture skills.
